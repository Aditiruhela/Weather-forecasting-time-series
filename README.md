# Weather Forecasting using Time Series

This project predicts the next day temperature using historical daily minimum temperature data.

## Dataset
Daily Minimum Temperatures (Melbourne)

## Approach
- Time-series analysis
- Lag features (previous day temperature)
- Moving averages (3-day, 7-day)
- Linear Regression model

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Model
- Linear Regression

## Evaluation
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## Result
The model predicts daily temperature with reasonable accuracy.

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run all cells sequentially
3. Observe predictions and visualizations
